# 1PlanarTester

A Python implementation of the algorithm to test and embedd 1-planar graphs as described in the paper of Binucci et al. "An Experimental Study of a 1-Planarity Testing and Embedding Algorithm" https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-39881-1_28 using the python networkx library as a basis.
